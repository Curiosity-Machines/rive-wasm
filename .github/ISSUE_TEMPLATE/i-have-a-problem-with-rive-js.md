### Description
<-- A clear and concise description of what the problem is. -->

### Provide a Repro
<-- 
Please provide the most **minimal repro** you can:
- If the problem is small enough, paste a code snippet
- Otherwise, you can attach a ZIP archive or paste a link to a GitHub repository with the bundle that reproduces the issue

-->

#### Source `.riv`/`.rev` file
<-- 
Attaching runtime-exported `.riv` file that reproduces the issue is immensely helpful for our team to identify the problem as fast as possible and fix it.
Please also include the source (`.rev`) by [downloading a backup](https://rive.app/community/doc/exporting/dockj1y5YeDd#for-backup) from the Editor. 

N.B. Because GitHub only supports certain file types use a ZIP archive to upload `.riv`/`.rev` files to this issue.

You can also privately share the `.riv`/`.rev` file with us at hello@rive.app.
